Learning ReactJS - TODO App

Running this app:

```
$ npm install
$ ./node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server
```
  
### Note:
Bear in mind that this is just a playground. There are a lot of things missing in this app.
I did't add a _delete_ functionality. I haven't styled it (although I added Bootstrap 4, for some reason).
Adding and updating the JSON was done in a very messy way, my goal was just to understand how ReactJS works so I took many shortcuts.
