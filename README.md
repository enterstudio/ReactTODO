### About this repo:
I've created this repo to practise what I've learned on the first part of this ReactJS course - https://frontendmasters.com/courses/react/ - I definitely recommend it.

Regarding the code in this repo, just bear in mind that this is a playground. There are a lot of things missing in this app.
I did't add a _delete_ functionality. I haven't styled it (although I added Bootstrap 4, for some reason).
Adding and updating the JSON was done in a very messy way, my goal was just to understand how ReactJS works so I took many shortcuts `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
